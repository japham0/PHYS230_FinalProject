## Description

The goal of this project is to be able to model and visualize fluid phase-separation
using continuum modeling techniques. To do so, we solve the standard Cahn-Hillard equation 
using finite-differencing schemes. From there, we implement a vortex forcing term to our 
system to examine the effects of a type of fluid flow to our phase separation model. We 
also wrote a python script which calculates the average size of an oil droplet after the
phase separation, given an image of the system after Nt timesteps. 

## Usage

Each of the Matlab codes as well as the python script can be downloaded and run separately. 

$$\int_{0}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}$$
